# DS18x20 1-Wire Temperature Sensor

Resolution: 12 bits
Addressing (in ROM): 8 bytes
- 1-byte family code (least significant byte)
- 6-byte unique address
- 1-byte CRC with the first 7 bytes of address in ROM (most significant byte)

DS18B20 is the replacement for DS18S20.

Source code: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/w1/slaves/w1_therm.c

The first 8 bytes of DS18x20 scatchpad contain the values for high- and low-temperature thresholds and configuration register. These bytes also contain the temperature value read by the DS1822 and reserved registers. Byte 9 is the CRC value calculated from the first 8 bytes.

## Instruction

### To enable 1-wire interface

Make relevant changes to `/config.txt` and reboot

To enable the default GPIO4 for 1-wire protocol, add the following line to `/config.txt`

```
dtoverlay=w1-gpio, gpiopin=x  # x is GPIO4 (default), GPIO17, GPIO27

# Or using parasitic mode
# Some people reported that GPIO could not drive DS1820 using parasitic power
#dtoverlay=w1-gpio-pullup,gpiopin=x  # Use GPIO to drive DS1820. x is any GPIO pin
```

Once the relevant pin is enabled for 1-wire protocol, and DS18x20 is connected properly to the pin, The w1 driver creates a subdirectory in `/sys/bys/w1/devices` for each sensor found.

`87 01 4b 46 7f ff 09 10 48` is scratchpad memory

`28 00 00 08 28 4f b7` is ROM (family code + unique address)
